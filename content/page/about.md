title: About me
---

I'm a **PhD researcher** at the **University of Edinburgh**, where I work on improving the interpretability of advanced regression models known as Generalized Additive Models for Location, Scale and Shape (GAMLSS).

### History

2021-22, I worked as a **Data Scientist** and have learned that advanced regression methods usually delivered more business value to my clients than the more popular *machine learning* models would. 

2020-21, I completed an **MSc in Applied Statistics and Data Mining** at the **University of St Andrews**, and received the Royal Statistical Society Award for the highest GPA out of all statistical MSc students in 2021.

## Statement of purpose

I'm extremely passionate about advanced regression models, because they're much more widely applicable than most standard statistics curriculums allow their students to realise.

If applied right, regression can be used to:

- identify key drivers of a business outcome
- give answers to 'what if...' scenarios
- forecast the business outcome
- identify anomalous observations

This blog is about delivering these business outcomes, making your stakeholders happy, and giving you that big bonus at the end of the year.
